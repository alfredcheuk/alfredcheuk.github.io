/*
    So you like the style of impress.js demo?
    Or maybe you are just curious how it was done?

    You couldn't find a better place to find out!

    Welcome to the stylesheet impress.js demo presentation.

    Please remember that it is not meant to be a part of impress.js and is
    not required by impress.js.
    I expect that anyone creating a presentation for impress.js would create
    their own set of styles.

    But feel free to read through it and learn how to get the most of what
    impress.js provides.

    And let me be your guide.

    Shall we begin?

    We start with a good ol' reset.
    That's the one by Eric Meyer http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/

    You can probably argue if it is needed here, or not, but for sure it
    doesn't do any harm and gives us a fresh start.

    Because the main point behind the impress.js demo is to demo impress.js
    we display a fallback message for users with browsers that don't support
    all the features required by it.

    All of the content will be still fully accessible for them, but I want
    them to know that they are missing something - that's what the demo is
    about, isn't it?

    And then we hide the message, when support is detected in the browser.
